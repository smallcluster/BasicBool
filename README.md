# ![Alt text](Logo128.png?raw=true "Title") BasicBool

A Windows/Linux application written in C++ to visualize computing using boolean logic.

## Disclaimer

THIS IS A TOY PROJECT to help me learn C++, CMake, OS abstraction, GUI architecture and many more...
It will take A LOT of time to get something usable, and even more time to have a clean architecture/coding style.

## Project Goals

- no external libraries apart from GLAD for OpenGL extension loading (Whatâ€™s the best way to learn than reinventing the wheel?)
- modern OpenGL
- cross-platform
- simple immediate mode GUI
- save system
