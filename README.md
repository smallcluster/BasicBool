![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/smallcluster/BasicBool?logo=Github)

A Windows (Linux support not yet implemented) application written in C++ to visualize computing using boolean logic.

## Disclaimer

THIS IS A TOY PROJECT to help me learn C++, CMake, OS abstraction, OpenGL and many more...
It will take A LOT of time to get something usable, and even more time to have a clean architecture/coding style.

## Project Goals

- no external libraries apart from GLAD for OpenGL extension loading and stb_image for image loading
- modern OpenGL
- cross-platform
- ~~simple immediate mode GUI~~
- save system
